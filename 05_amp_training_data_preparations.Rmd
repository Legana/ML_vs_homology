## Starting over with a new AMP database

A new AMP database was constructed which included:

- the reviewed AMPs from UniProt (accessed 07 July 2021) - 3,242 AMPs
- the unreviewed AMPs in the UniProt database, if present in the AMP databases APD, DRAMP or dbAMP (accessed 09 April 2021)  - 170 AMPs
- Total AMPs: 3,412

This approach is consistent with the creation of ampir's models and detailed in [01_collate_databases.md in the AMP_pub repository](https://github.com/Legana/AMP_pub/blob/master/01_collate_databases.md).

```{r}
uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps <- readRDS("data/uniprot_amps_w_amp_dbsJuly21.rds") %>%
  rename(Entry_name = `Entry name`) %>% 
  mutate(Organism = str_remove(Organism, " \\(.*")) %>% 
  rename(Taxonomic_lineage = `Taxonomic lineage (ALL)`) %>% 
  rename(Order = `Taxonomic lineage (ORDER)`) %>% 
  rename(Phylum = `Taxonomic lineage (PHYLUM)`) %>%
  rename(Class = `Taxonomic lineage (CLASS)`) %>%
  mutate(Order = str_remove(Order, " \\(.*")) %>%
  mutate(Organism = str_replace_all(Organism, " ", "_")) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Removing sequences containing anything other than the standard AA results in 3,354 sequences
```{r}
amps_standardaa <- uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>% select("Entry_name", "Sequence") %>% as.data.frame() %>% remove_nonstandard_aa()
```


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df_to_faa(amps_standardaa, "cache/amps_standardaa.fasta")
```

Use `cd-hit` to remove highly similar sequences

```bash
cd-hit -i cache/amps_standardaa.fasta -o cache/amps_standardaa.fasta90.fasta -c 0.90 -g 1
```


```{r}
amps_standardaa90 <- read_faa("cache/amps_standardaa.fasta90.fasta") %>% 
  left_join(uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps, by = c("seq_name" = "Entry_name"))
```

`cd-hit` resulted in 2,339 representative sequences. `r nrow(amps_standardaa90 %>% filter(between(Length, 50, 500)))` of these sequences are between 50 and 500 AA long, which is the length filter that will be applied to train the classification models. 


The phyla Chordata, Arthropoda and Streptophyta contain the most AMPs. Therefore I want to pick the organism with the most AMPs in each taxonomic group within these three phyla.

The phyla Evosea and Nematoda both have a single organism (*D. discoideum* (amoeba) and *C. elegans* (roundworm), respectively) with around 10 AMPs which could maybe be added to the test.
The remaining phyla only have organisms that have less than 5 AMPs each, so these are not worth adding. 

Notes: How many AMPs present for each *chosen* organism in new training DB. Use range of taxonomic distances to stretch out distance x axis.
10 borderline, over 20 is good. 


```{r}
uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
  mutate(in_90 = Entry_name %in% amps_standardaa90$seq_name) %>%
  filter(!grepl("Bacteria", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("Viruses", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>%
  group_by(Phylum) %>%
  summarise(AMP_count = n(), AMP_standardaa_90 = sum(in_90)) %>%
  arrange(.by_group = TRUE, desc(AMP_count))
```

## Chordata 

### Organisms with most AMPs according to taxonomic **Class**

 - *Mus musculus* (mammal with 104 AMPs)
 - *Bombina maxima* (toad with 50 AMPs)
 - *Gallus gallus* (bird with 25 AMPs) 
 - *Oncorhynchus mykiss* (fish with 12 AMPs)
 - *Styela clava* (tunicate with 11 AMPs)
 - *Crotalus durissus terrificus* (snake with 10 AMPs)
 

```{r}
uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
  mutate(in_90 = Entry_name %in% amps_standardaa90$seq_name) %>%
  filter(!grepl("Bacteria", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>% 
  filter(Phylum == "Chordata") %>%
  group_by(Order, Organism, Class) %>%
  summarise(AMP_count = n(), AMP_standardaa_90 = sum(in_90)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Class) %>%
  slice_max(AMP_count, n = 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(AMP_count)) 
```

If taking the top organisms per **Order**, where each organism has at least 10 AMPs, the following organisms would be candidates:

 - *Mus musculus* (mouse, mammal, 104 AMPs)
 - *Homo sapiens* (human, mammal, 96 AMPs)
 - *Bos taurus* (cattle, mammal, 58 AMPs)
 - *Oryctolagus cuniculus* (rabbit, mammal, 17 AMPs)
 - *Ornithorhynchus anatinus* (platypus, mammal, 11 AMPs )
 - *Bombina maxima* (toad, amphibian, 50 AMPs)
 - *Gallus gallus* (junglefowl, bird, 25 AMPs)
 - *Oncorhynchus mykiss* (fish with 12 AMPs)
 - *Styela clava* (tunicate with 11 AMPs)
 - *Crotalus durissus terrificus* (snake with 10 AMPs)
 
However, the toad *Bombina maxima*, does not have an available reference proteome. The only [reference proteomes available for anurans](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/?query=taxonomy%3A%22Anura+%289ANUR%29+%5B8342%5D%22&sort=score) are: *Xenopus tropicalis* (*Silurana tropicalis*), *Xenopus leavis* and *Lithobates catesbeianus* (*Rana catesbeiana*) which have 9, 10 and 13 AMPs, respectively. *Lithobates catesbeianus* has the most AMPs of these three frogs but also has the most missing values (70%) in its reference proteome BUSCO score. 

The tunicate, *Styela clava* and the snake *Crotalus durissus terrificus* do not have a proteome either and the other organisms within their respective class have less than four known AMPs. 
 
The majority of this list are mammals. The platypus however, is a monotreme, and not a typical placental (eutherian) mammal, like the mouse, human, cattle and rabbit are. Monotremes diverged earlier from the mammalian common ancestor compared to the placental mammals and subsequently have different characteristics [(Deakin, Graves and Rens 2012)](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/339433) 



```{r}
uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
  mutate(in_90 = Entry_name %in% amps_standardaa90$seq_name) %>%
  filter(!grepl("Bacteria", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>% 
  filter(Phylum == "Chordata") %>%
  group_by(Order, Organism, Class) %>%
  summarise(AMP_count = n(), AMP_standardaa_90 = sum(in_90)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Order) %>%
  slice_max(AMP_count, n = 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(AMP_count)) %>%
  head(10)
```


```{r}
frog_amps <- uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
  filter(Order == "Anura") %>%
  count(Order, Organism, sort = TRUE, name = "AMP_count")
```


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#initial look grouped by Order (top organism with most AMPs for each order)
uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
  filter(!grepl("Bacteria", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>% 
  filter(Phylum == "Chordata") %>%
  count(Order, Organism, Class, sort = TRUE, name = "AMP_count") %>%
  group_by(Order) %>%
  slice_max(AMP_count, n = 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(AMP_count)) %>%
  head(51)
```


## Arthropoda 

If choosing the organism with the most AMPs per **Order**, the following organisms would be chosen:

- *Lachesana tarabaevi* (ant spider, arachnid, 28 AMPs)
- *Drosophila melanogaster* (fruitfly, insect, 23 AMPs)
- *Penaeus vannamei* (shrimp, decapod, 18 AMPs)
- *Neoponera goeldii* (ant, insect, 15 AMPs)
- *Bombyx mori* (moth, insect, 15 AMPs)
- *Tachypleus tridentatus* (horseshoe crab, 11 AMPs)
- *Chaerilus_tricostatus* (scorpion, arachnid, 10 AMPs)


*Neoponera goeldii*, *Tachypleus tridentatus* and *Chaerilus tricostatus* do not have a reference proteome and therefore could not be included. 

```{r}
uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
  mutate(in_90 = Entry_name %in% amps_standardaa90$seq_name) %>%
  filter(!grepl("Bacteria", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>% 
  filter(Phylum == "Arthropoda") %>%
  group_by(Order, Organism, Class) %>%
  summarise(AMP_count = n(), AMP_standardaa_90 = sum(in_90)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Order) %>%
  slice_max(AMP_count, n = 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(AMP_count)) %>%
  head(10)
```

## Streptophyta

For plants only *Arabidopsis thaliana* would be chosen which has 284 AMPs (after `cd-hit`)


```{r}
uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
  mutate(in_90 = Entry_name %in% amps_standardaa90$seq_name) %>%
  filter(!grepl("Bacteria", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>% 
  filter(Phylum == "Streptophyta") %>%
  group_by(Order, Organism, Class) %>%
  summarise(AMP_count = n(), AMP_standardaa_90 = sum(in_90)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Order) %>%
  slice_max(AMP_count, n = 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(AMP_count)) %>%
  head(10)

```

## Bacteria

Bacteria contain AMPs called bacteriocins used for competitive advantages. *Escherichia coli* contains the most known AMPs (29) and have two reference proteomes corresponding to two different strains: K12 and 0157:H7 where the latter is considered to be the pathogenic strain, which is inhibited by AMPs produced from the non-pathogenic *E. coli* strains [(Askari and Ghanbarpour 2019)](https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-018-1771-y)

```{r}
bacteriocins <- uniprot_and_amp_dbs_amps %>%
 filter(grepl("Bacteria", Taxonomic_lineage)) %>%
 count(Organism, sort = TRUE, name = "AMP_count")
```
